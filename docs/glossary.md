# build-product-v2 — Glossary of Abbreviations

Decoder for the acronyms, shorthand, and codebase-specific jargon used
across the 35 skills in `.claude/skills/`. Each entry gives the
expansion plus the *contextual* meaning in this repo (not the generic
Wikipedia definition).

Sections are alphabetical within each group.

## 1. Codebase-specific (read this first)

These are not industry standards — they're invented by this orchestrator.
You will not find them anywhere else.

| Term | Means | Where it shows up |
|---|---|---|
| **WEDGE** | One-sentence product thesis: ICP + axis + mechanism. The north star every downstream skill reads. | `01c-wedge.md`, every skill |
| **DRAFT** / **LOCKED** | Artifact status. DRAFT = still has open issues. LOCKED = passed critic gate, downstream skills allowed to consume it. | All strategic artifacts |
| **HC1 / HC2 / HC3 / HC4** | Human Checkpoints 1–4. Non-skippable user confirmations: wedge/ICP, design target, pricing/positioning, GO/NO-GO. | `build-product-v2/SKILL.md` |
| **toy / preview / launch / scale** | Scale tiers. Each skips a different list of ops phases. Default = `preview`. | `build-product-v2`, `tech-stack-selector` |
| **BLOCKED / SHIP / POLISH / LOOP / RETHINK** | Dogfood verdicts after a real-browser walk of the wedge workflow. Each verdict routes to a different recovery phase. | `dogfood/SKILL.md` |
| **PHASE_RESULT** | Structured block every subagent must return — `phase`, `status`, `artifact_path`, `summary`, etc. The orchestrator merges only this block into state, never the conversational text. | `build-product-v2/SKILL.md` |
| **CRITIC_VERDICT** | Structured block from a critic gate — `verdict: pass\|fail`, `must_fix`, `nice_to_have`, `evidence_quality`. | All `_critic` gates |
| **ADR** | Architectural Decision Record — appended to `state/state.json:decisions[]` and `state/decisions.md` via `state-decide.sh`. | State machine |
| **SRS** | System Requirements Specification — IEEE 830-shaped doc produced by `analyst`. | `analyst/SKILL.md` |
| **FR / NFR** | Functional / Non-Functional Requirement. Tagged `[wedge-critical]`, `[wedge-supporting]`, or `[V2]`. | `analyst`, `backend-developer`, `reviewer` |
| **PRR** | Production Readiness Review — final scale-tier-only gate before launch. Also the name of the skill (`production-readiness`). | `production-readiness/SKILL.md` |

## 11. Quick lookup — verdicts and statuses

When you see a one-word verdict in a SKILL.md, it almost certainly comes from one of these four enums:

| Enum | Possible values | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact status** | `DRAFT` · `LOCKED` | All strategic artifacts |
| **Critic verdict** | `pass` · `fail` | All `_critic` gates |
| **Phase status** | `done` · `failed` · `draft` | `state.phase_status[*]` |
| **Dogfood verdict** | `BLOCKED` · `SHIP` · `POLISH` · `LOOP` · `RETHINK` | `dogfood/SKILL.md` |

If you see a CAPS word that's not in this table, treat it as a regular acronym and search this glossary.
